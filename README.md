##Slide Show

This slide show is a simple, modular, jQuery slideshow. It can be implemented in most websites very simply. My images are all 800 x 600, but since they are of varying heights, I found it is best to set the slideshow to full screen. 

This is part of a project to create fun website "widgets" that can be easily implemented to make a website more fun.
